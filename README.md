# Black Friday Sales Prediction Using Machine Learning

This GitHub repository hosts the Black Friday Sales Prediction project, which utilizes machine learning to analyze customer purchasing behavior and predict sales. The project leverages past sales data to help businesses offer personalized deals and better understand their customers. 

Key aspects of the project include:

* **Data Analysis:** Examining customer demographics and purchase patterns to derive insights, such as spending tendencies based on gender, occupation, and city category.
* **Predictive Modeling:** Employing machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost to predict customer purchase amounts.
* **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing data, label encoding, and scaling categorical data for improved model accuracy.
* **Validation and Results:** Splitting the data into training and testing sets and validating the models using root mean square error, with XGBoost providing the most accurate results.

This project aims to offer businesses critical insights into consumer behavior during major sales events like Black Friday, enabling them to optimize their sales strategiesâ€‹.
